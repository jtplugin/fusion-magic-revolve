## üìã Overview

JT Magic Revolve is a powerful plugin for Autodesk Fusion 360 that enables you to create multiple copies of 3D bodies with controlled translation and rotation along separate axes. Perfect for creating complex patterns, spirals, and repetitive structures where you need to generate multiple instances of objects with precise positioning and rotation control.

The plugin is available in two versions:
- **Trial Version:** Basic revolving with limitations
- **Pro Version:** Full-featured revolving with advanced capabilities

- **Visual Preview:** Shows axis direction in dialog

### Operation Priority Configuration
- **Rotation‚ÜíTranslation:** Rotate first, then translate
  - Best for: Classic spiral patterns
  - Effect: Bodies rotate around their original position, then move
- **Translation‚ÜíRotation:** Translate first, then rotate
  - Best for: Distributed patterns
  - Effect: Bodies move to new position, then rotate around that position

### Distance Configuration
- **Positive Values:** Move in positive direction along axis
- **Negative Values:** Move in negative direction along axis
- **Zero Distance:** Bodies remain at same position (rotation only)
- **Units:** Uses current Fusion 360 document units
- **Smart Calculation:** Plugin validates reasonable distances

### Number of Pieces Configuration
- **Trial Version:** Maximum 2 pieces
- **Pro Version:** Maximum 1000 pieces
- **Minimum:** 1 piece (original body only)
- **Validation:** Plugin warns for excessive body counts

### Rotation Angle Configuration
- **Positive Values:** Clockwise rotation
- **Negative Values:** Counter-clockwise rotation
- **Zero Angle:** No rotation between bodies
- **Range:** -360¬∞ to +360¬∞ per body
- **Cumulative:** Each body rotates relative to the previous

### Naming Conventions
**Trial Version:**
- Format: `[NameRoot]_001`, `[NameRoot]_002`, etc.
- Automatic numbering with zero-padding
- Default root: "Revol"

**Pro Version:**

- **Smart Numbering:** Automatic sequential numbering
- **Pattern Examples:**
  - `Spiral_Part_001`, `Spiral_Part_002`
  - `Pattern_A_001`, `Pattern_A_002`
  - `Custom_Name_001`, `Custom_Name_002`

- **Easy Management:** Expand/collapse groups for clean timeline

### Pattern Creation Strategies

**Spiral Patterns - Best For:**
- Decorative elements and ornaments
- Artistic installations
- Engineering components like springs

**Linear Arrays - Best For:**
- Assembly line patterns
- Manufacturing fixtures
- Educational demonstrations
- Prototype development
- **Setup:** Translation priority, zero rotation angle

**Circular Patterns - Best For:**

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Body selection is invalid"**
- Ensure you've selected a valid solid or surface body
- Check that body is not part of a component assembly
- Verify body has proper geometry

**"Translation axis is invalid"**
- **TRIAL:** Ensure selected axis is a construction axis (X, Y, Z)
- **PRO:** Ensure selected edge is linear, sketch line is valid, or construction axis exists
- Verify axis has proper direction and length

**"Rotation axis is invalid"**
- **TRIAL:** Ensure selected axis is a construction axis (X, Y, Z)
- **PRO:** Ensure selected edge is linear, sketch line is valid, or construction axis exists
- Verify axis has proper direction and length

**"Too many bodies requested"**
- **Trial version:** Reduce body count to 2 or upgrade to Pro
- **Pro version:** Confirm intention for large body count
- Consider performance impact of large operations

**"Revolving operation failed"**
- Check body geometry for errors
- Ensure adequate system memory
- Try simpler geometry or fewer bodies
- Verify axis selections are valid

**Help not working**
- Ensure internet connection is active
- Check firewall settings for browser access
- Try refreshing the help page

### Performance Optimization
- **Close unnecessary applications** before large revolving operations
- **Save your work** before running complex patterns
- **Use Preview mode** to verify settings before execution
- **Consider batch processing** for multiple bodies
